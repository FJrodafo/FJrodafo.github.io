If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists [here](https://github.com/FJrodafo/FJrodafo.github.io/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a pull/merge request with a fix [here](https://github.com/FJrodafo/FJrodafo.github.io/pulls). To work on the pull request, fork the repository [here](https://github.com/FJrodafo/FJrodafo.github.io/forks).

Please do not copy questions and answers from other sources, they probably worked hard to add them, and if you add new images, make sure they are free and usable.

Thank you very much for the contribution!
